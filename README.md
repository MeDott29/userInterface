# userInterface
this is an iterative, generative user interface
## Progress Report

### Date: [Today's Date]

We've made significant strides in developing our Dynamic Generative Project Management Framework (GDPmf). Our focus has been on creating a lightweight, efficient, and direct interface to the OpenAI API, designed to streamline the project management process.

We've defined the structure of our project data and decided to store this data in text files. Each file represents a project, and each line in the file represents a field in the database.

We've also started to build an assistant to help manage our projects. We've defined a set of functions for creating, listing, viewing, updating, and deleting projects. These functions are defined in a separate Python file (`projectFunctions.py`) to keep our code organized and maintainable.

We've updated our OpenAI assistant (`ProjectAssistant.py`) to use these functions. The assistant is now able to manage and answer questions about our dashboard project.

The next steps will involve implementing the user interface for the dashboard and connecting it to our project management functions and assistant.

Since our last update, we've started to build an assistant to help manage our projects. We've defined a set of functions for creating, listing, viewing, updating, and deleting projects. These functions are defined in a separate Python file (`projectFunctions.py`) to keep our code organized and maintainable.

We've also updated our OpenAI assistant (`ProjectAssistant.py`) to use these functions. 

The next steps will involve creating logic that links the assistant with our project management data.

### Date: [12/7/2023]

Today, we discussed the creation of a project dashboard to manage and interact with various projects. The dashboard will display project data in a useful and organized way, and provide a way to interact with the `math_asst.py` script.

We decided that the project data will be stored in text files, with each file representing a project. The structure of these text files was defined, with each line in the text file representing a field in the database.

We also compared the `math_asst.py` and `test_asst.py` scripts, discussing their similarities and differences.

The next steps will involve deciding on the dashboard interface and writing the code to connect everything together.
