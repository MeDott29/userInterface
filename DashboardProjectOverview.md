Generative Dynamic Project Management Framework (GDPmf). GDPmf is a lightweight, efficient, and direct interface to the OpenAI API, designed to streamline your project management process.

GDPmf provides a structured yet flexible framework for managing your projects. It offers dynamic data storage, a suite of project management functions, and an interactive dashboard interface. These features work in harmony to provide a comprehensive overview of your projects, making it easier to track progress and manage tasks.

But the true power of GDPmf lies in its simplicity and directness. It's designed to bring you as close as possible to the OpenAI API, providing a direct line to the powerful AI capabilities it offers. And once it's done that, GDPmf steps back, allowing you to interact with the API in the most efficient and effective way.

Experience the simplicity and power of direct AI interaction with the Dynamic Generative Project Management Framework. It's not just a tool, it's your gateway to the future of project management.

1. **Project Data**: First, you'll need a way to store and manage data about your projects. This could be a database, a spreadsheet, or even a collection of text files. The data might include the project name, description, status, associated files, and any other information you find relevant.

2. **Dashboard Interface**: Next, you'll need to create the dashboard interface. This could be a web page, a desktop application, or even a command-line tool, depending on your preference. The interface will need to display the project data in a useful and organized way. You might include features like a list or grid view of projects, the ability to sort and filter projects, and a detail view for each project.

3. **Integration with `@math_asst.py`**: If you want to interact with the `@math_asst.py` script from your dashboard, you'll need to provide a way to input commands and display responses. This could be a simple text input and output, or you could create a more complex interface that allows for easier input of numbers and operations.

4. **Code to Connect Everything**: Finally, you'll need to write code that ties everything together. This code will need to read data from your project data source, update the dashboard interface, handle user input, and interact with the `@math_asst.py` script.

# Project Management Dashboard

The Project Management Dashboard is a tool designed to help manage and interact with various projects. It provides a centralized interface where you can view, create, update, and delete projects.

## Features

1. **Project Data**: The dashboard stores data about each project in a text file. Each file represents a project, and each line in the file represents a field in the database. The data includes the project name, description, status, associated files, and any other relevant information.

2. **Dashboard Interface**: The dashboard interface displays the project data in a useful and organized way. It includes features like a list or grid view of projects, the ability to sort and filter projects, and a detail view for each project.

3. **Integration with `math_asst.py`**: The dashboard provides a way to interact with the `math_asst.py` script. Users can input commands and view responses directly from the dashboard.

4. **Project Management Functions**: The dashboard uses a set of functions to manage the project data. These functions allow users to create a new project, list all projects, view details about a project, update a project, and delete a project.

## Implementation

The dashboard is implemented using Python and the OpenAI API. The project management functions are defined in a separate Python file (`projectFunctions.py`) to keep the code organized and maintainable. The OpenAI assistant (`ProjectAssistant.py`) uses these functions to manage and answer questions about the dashboard project.

The next steps in the project will involve implementing the user interface for the dashboard and connecting it to the project management functions and assistant.
