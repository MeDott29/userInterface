Today, I have a lot of goals and ideas.  
I want to make a checklist for putting an app into production.  The goal of which being to open myself up to the possibility of gathering revenue from the user.  Customer satisfaction is of utmost import.
The checklist will outline a viable procedure with the minimum amount of steps and complexity. There will inevitably be several iteration steps. Also, gathering of resources.

But first, I have to get in control of my own data.
I have to learn the tools that allow me to utilize the assistant to the best of our abilities while also retaining ownership of my data.
This is important to me because my research should be my own when no one is paying me for it.
