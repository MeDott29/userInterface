Project Name: Project Dashboard
Description: This project involves creating a dashboard to manage and interact with various projects. The dashboard will display project data in a useful and organized way, and provide a way to interact with the `@math_asst.py` script.
Status: In Progress
Associated Files: DashboardProjectOverview.txt, math_asst.py, test_asst.py
Other Info: The project data will be stored in text files, with each file representing a project. The dashboard interface is yet to be decided. The code to connect everything will read data from the project data source, update the dashboard interface, handle user input, and interact with the `@math_asst.py` script.
